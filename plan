I need a 2d array that stores information about every spot on the grid

-first create a 1d array, than add to every column a new array so it will be a 2d array

-create a NodeClass this will be the type of every spot on the grid

-the NodeClass should take as a parameter the X and Y  coordinates and the id of html id so it can change it s color later

- the NodeClass constructor should also create the html element on the grid

openSet - still need to be evaluated
closedSet - all the nodes finished being evaluated, (it is not the right path)

- openSet[] = grid[0][0]

Main logic

While the openSet is not empty -- we still have more nodes to evaluate
    We look for the node in the openSet witch has the lowest cost (f).
        And we go there (set it as current)
        If current is the end then we found the path
        if not we remove it form te openSet and put it in the closed set
